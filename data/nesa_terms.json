        "description": "Teachers can use this glossary to help students comprehend what an exam question requires.",
        "example": "For instance, students can enhance their responses to 'explain' questions by knowing that in different subjects, 'explain' may require them to: show a cause and effect, make the relationships between things evident, provide why and/or how."

        "Key words are best discussed with students within the context of the questions and tasks they are working on, rather than in isolation.",
        "It is crucial to avoid rigid interpretations of key words.",
        "Subject-specific interpretations must be considered (e.g., 'evaluate' differs between Maths and History).",
        "HSC exam questions may also include self-explanatory terms like 'how,' 'why,' or 'to what extent.'"
